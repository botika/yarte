# Parallel Raytracing
> Adapted from [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/examples/raytrace-parallel)
>
> Make sure to have `rust` at nightly and `wasm-bindgen-cli` at the last version

You can build the example locally with:

```
$ ./build.sh [port]
```

(or running the commands on Windows manually)

and then visiting http://localhost:8000 in a browser should run the example!
