# Yarte [![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/yarte.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/yarte) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte) [![Financial Contributors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/yarte/all/badge.svg?label=financial+contributors)](https://opencollective.com/yarte)
Yarte stands for **Y**et **A**nother **R**ust **T**emplate **E**ngine, 
is the fastest template engine. Uses a Handlebars-like syntax, 
well-known and intuitive for most developers. Yarte is an optimized, and easy-to-use 
rust crate, with which developers can create logic around their 
HTML templates using conditionals, loops, rust code and template composition. 

## Features
- Meta programming system with all Rust expressions, conditionals, loops or modules
- Recursion in partial at compile time
- Zero copy helpers
- Render numbers with [Itoa](https://github.com/dtolnay/itoa) and [Dtoa](https://github.com/dtolnay/dtoa) (thanks to dtolnay)
- A [fancy-text debug](https://asciinema.org/a/WEY4Hu17p8qn51b5DEpBVqLL1?autoplay=1) mode to visualize the code generated by Yarte
- Emit snipped annotations at error

### Is it really the fastest?
See it for yourself in the [benchmarks][bench]!
