# Yarte [![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/yarte.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/yarte) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte)
Yarte stands for **Y**et **A**nother **R**ust **T**emplate **E**ngine. Uses a Handlebars-like syntax, 
well-known and intuitive for most developers. Yarte is an optimized, and easy-to-use 
rust crate, with which developers can create logic around their 
HTML templates using conditionals, loops, rust code and template composition. 

## Features
- Meta programming system with all Rust expressions, conditionals, loops or modules
- Recursion in partial at compile time
- Zero copy helpers
- `fmt::Display` and optimized `memcopy` implementation for render to bytes
- Render numbers with [`Itoa`](https://github.com/dtolnay/itoa), [`Dtoa`](https://github.com/dtolnay/dtoa), [`Ryu`](https://github.com/dtolnay/ryu) and itoa simd
- A [fancy-text debug](https://asciinema.org/a/TQAodSQXevgHgO01vzC6vdo6v?autoplay=1) mode to visualize the code generated by Yarte
- Emit snipped annotations at error
- Integrated, zero copy and infallible, simd json serializer
- Infallible render

### Is it really fast?
See it for yourself in the [TechEmpower benchmarks][bench] with [`ntex`][ntex] 
and in the [js-framework-benchmark](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2020/table_chrome_85.0.4183.83.html)!

## Acknowledgment
Yarte is based on all previous templates engines, syntax as well as its documentation 
is highly influenced by [Handlebars][handlebars].
