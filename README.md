# Yarte [![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/yarte.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/yarte) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte) [![Financial Contributors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/yarte/all/badge.svg?label=financial+contributors)](https://opencollective.com/yarte)
Yarte stands for **Y**et **A**nother **R**ust **T**emplate **E**ngine, 
is the fastest template engine. Uses a Handlebars-like syntax, 
well known and intuitive for most developers. Yarte is an optimized, and easy-to-use 
rust crate, with which developers can create logic around their 
HTML templates using conditionals, loops, rust code and template composition. 

## Features
- Meta programming system around template with Rust expressions, conditionals or loops
- Recursion in partial at compile time
- Html minifier
- A [fancy-text debug](https://asciinema.org/a/kZsMW95ujo8l6uOdkBurlbytw?autoplay=1) mode to visualize the code generated by Yarte
- Emit snipped annotations of the template at error
- Mode `server` for wasm app isomorphic server side
- Incorporates feature `with-actix-web`, an implementation of `actix-web`'s trait Responder

#### Is it really the fastest?
 See it for yourself in the [benchmarks][bench]!

## Documentation
In order to  fully understand Yarte's capabilities take a look at the following documentation:
- [Tests](./yarte/tests)
- [Our book](https://yarte.netlify.com/)
- [Crate documentation](https://docs.rs/yarte/)
- Minimum supported Rust version: 1.40 or later

## Roadmap
- [ ] [#37](https://github.com/botika/yarte/issues/37) Derive for compiled DOM, implement [`App`](./yarte_wasm_app/src/lib.rs) trait 
- [ ] Minify Css
- [ ] intellij plugin (help wanted)
- [ ] yarte/html/css UI like [sciter](https://sciter.com/)
- [ ] ... you can open a issue!

We are not looking for anything other than **render HTML** and text as fast as possible

## Acknowledgment
Yarte is based on all previous templates engines, syntax as well as its documentation 
is highly influenced by [Handlebars][handlebars]. As many ideas as possible used in 
Yarte are from other repositories. 

Comments in the code clarify which ideas are used, and from where.
